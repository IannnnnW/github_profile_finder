This application takes advantage of the GitHub API to retrieve different GitHub users' data. I used two endpoints, the first endpoint provides the user's username,
profile-photo and information on followers, company, and personal site. The second endpoint provides data concerning the users latest five repositiories. This can 
help users to quickly explore other users' latest work.
